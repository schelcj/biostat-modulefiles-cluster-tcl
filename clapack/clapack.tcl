module-whatis "Description: The CLAPACK library was built using a Fortran to C conversion utility called f2c. The entire Fortran 77 LAPACK library is run through f2c to obtain C code, and then modified to improve readability. CLAPACK's goal is to provide LAPACK for someone who does not have access to a Fortran compiler."
